This document outlines the steps necessary to get our code up and running on your computer. If you have questions, you can email us at luzarragan@gmail.com or 

1. Operating System  
We recommend running Linux on your computer, as it is necessary if you want to use the simulator features in MAVProxy or the Piksi console. Running Linux in a virtual machine also create problems, so we recommend partitioning your drive and installing Linux on one of the partions. We used MacBook laptops and there are a variety of tutorials online that explain how to partition your drive and install Linux. We used rEFInd, which is a boot manager that will allow you to choose between Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, and other operating systems when you boot your computer. The exact steps for installing rEFInd will depend on what version of Mac OS X you are running. For our Linux operating system, we installed Ubuntu 14.04. To install packages on Ubuntu, you will use apt-get command, which you can read about here: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt-get.html  

2. Install Piksi console  
Because you are now running Linux, you will need to run the Piksi console from source. The instructions for installing the Piksi console can be found on the Swift Nav website:

3. Install MAVProxy

4. Communicating Between the Piksi Console and MAVProxy: Memcache
