For background on our project, you can find a copy of our final report here:

This document outlines the steps necessary to get our code up and running on your computer.

1. Operating System  
We recommend running Linux on your computer, as it is necessary if you want to use the simulator feature in MAVProxy or the Piksi console. Running Linux in a virtual machine also create problems, so we recommend partitioning your drive and installing Linux on one of the partions. We used MacBook laptops and there are a variety of tutorials online about how to partition your drive and install Linux. We will not write every step of the process here, but will simply state that in our experience, it was worth the effort to install Linux because everything else ran more smoothly.
